# Your Nigerian Health Guide

This guide combines information on symptom triage, maternal and child health, medicine availability, and healthcare financing in Nigeria.  Remember to always consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice. This information is for guidance only and does not replace professional medical care.


## I. Symptom Triage

To help you get the right care, please describe your symptoms in detail.  Include:

* **What are your symptoms?** (e.g., fever, cough, headache, stomach ache, etc.)
* **How long have you had these symptoms?**
* **Where do you feel the symptoms?**
* **Are there any other symptoms?**
* **What is your location?** (State and town/city – this is crucial for directing you to the right resources and assessing medicine availability)
* **Do you have any pre-existing medical conditions?**
* **Are you currently taking any medications?**

Based on your answers, I can provide more specific guidance on whether you need immediate medical attention, what type of healthcare facility to visit (Primary Healthcare Centre (PHC), general hospital, etc.), and what steps you should take.  If your symptoms are severe (e.g., difficulty breathing, severe chest pain, heavy bleeding), seek immediate medical attention at the nearest hospital.


## II. Maternal & Child Health

**(This section mirrors the provided Maternal & Child Health guide with minor adjustments for clarity and flow.)**

This guide provides information on antenatal care, supplements, nutrition, and immunization schedules for mothers and children in Nigeria, in accordance with national guidelines.  Remember to always consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice.  This information is for guidance only and does not replace professional medical care.

**I. Antenatal Care (ANC)**

* **Free Antenatal Care:** The Nigerian government provides free antenatal care at Primary Health Care (PHC) centers across the country. Regular visits are crucial. Aim for at least four visits.

* **What to Expect:** Weight and blood pressure checks, urine tests, blood tests (blood group, haemoglobin, HIV, syphilis), fetal growth assessment (ultrasound if available), nutrition counseling, hygiene advice, tetanus vaccination, childbirth preparation advice, and breastfeeding advice.

* **Finding a PHC:** Contact your Local Government Area (LGA) health office or visit the Federal Ministry of Health website.


**II. Essential Supplements**

* **Iron and Folic Acid:** Crucial for preventing anaemia and neural tube defects. Your healthcare provider will prescribe the dosage.  These are usually free at PHCs.

* **Other Nutrients:** A balanced diet is essential. Consult a healthcare professional or nutritionist.


**III. Nutrition for Mothers and Children**

* **Pregnancy:** Eat a variety of nutrient-rich foods including iron, calcium, and Vitamin D sources.

* **Complementary Feeding (after 6 months):** Introduce soft, easily digestible foods, gradually increasing texture and variety. Ensure foods are safe and hygienically prepared.


**IV. Nigeria’s Routine Immunization Schedule (NPHCDA)**

The National Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPHCDA) provides a comprehensive immunization schedule.  This schedule may vary slightly depending on the region. It's crucial to adhere to the schedule. All vaccines are free at designated PHCs.  **Always confirm the schedule with your local PHC.**
