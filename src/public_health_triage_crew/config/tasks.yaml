public_health_triage_task:
  description: >
    Conduct a comprehensive triage assessment for the patient based on their reported symptoms, 
    demographic information, and medical history. Analyze the symptoms in the context of common 
    diseases in Nigeria (malaria, typhoid, respiratory infections, etc.) and determine the 
    appropriate level of care needed.
    
    Patient Information Available:
    - Name: {patient_name}
    - Age: {age}
    - Gender: {gender}
    - Location: {location}
    - Symptoms: {symptoms}
    - Severity Level: {symptom_severity}
    - Selected Symptoms: {selected_symptoms}
    - Medical History: {medical_history}
    
    Classify urgency as one of the following with clear justification:
    - **Home Care**: Mild symptoms manageable with rest, hydration, and over-the-counter medications
    - **Primary Health Centre (PHC)**: Moderate symptoms requiring basic medical attention and monitoring
    - **General Hospital**: Serious symptoms requiring specialized diagnostic tools and treatment
    - **Teaching Hospital**: Critical or complex cases requiring advanced medical intervention and specialists
    
    Consider factors such as symptom severity, duration, patient age, underlying conditions, 
    and potential for rapid deterioration. Provide specific red flags that would warrant 
    immediate escalation to higher levels of care.
